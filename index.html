        Hello, my name is Alex Gu<br><br>
        My major is Computer Science in the School of Engineering <br><br>
        My IP Address is 10.0.0.148 <br><br>
        I grew up in Ashland Massachusetts, just 35 minutes away from Tufts.<br><br>
        Something that people wouldn't expect about me is that I have a big addiction to 
        sparkling water and carbonation. <br><br>
        I don't have a specific favorite place that I like to be, but my favorite environment
        is a snowy, christmas feeling night. It is super cozy! <br><br><br><br>
